title: 'Week 1: Evidence-Based Practice'
description:
  'The notion of evidence-based (or evidence-informed) practice is
  well-established in nursing and in the health sciences in general. We will
  examine the evolution of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement, and
  different models for conceptualizing EBP. We will discuss both the purported
  benefits and the criticisms of the EBP movement in healthcare.'

Time for some reading. This

paper</a> focuses in on the 'evidence' aspect of evidence-based practice. The
authors take a somewhat different stance to the original notion of EBP devised
by David Sackett and colleagues, in that they conceptualized 'evidence' as also
incorporating knowledge derived from sources other than original research -
namely 'clinical experience', 'patient experience' and information from the
'local context'.

<exercise id="4" title="Important distinctions between different EBP models" >
What is the major difference between the two different EBP models presented below?<br><br>
<choice>
<opt text="One model values patient-centred care more than clinical expertise" correct="true">

Good job! It is clear the Rycroft-Malone model is heavily focused on the outcome
of achieving patient-centered care by explictly stating this outcome in the
center of the model. In contrast, 'clinical expertise' is seen as the core
element unifying the other components of achieving evidence-based clinical
decisions in the other model.

</opt>

<opt text="Health care resources are not considered in both models">

This is one of the differences, however, what is different at the 'core'
(center) of these two different models, suggesting it as the component of most
value to the model? </opt>

<exercise id="7" title="ACE Star Model of Knowledge Transformation">

A different model that presents an even more process-focused view of
evidence-based practice is the ACE Star Model of Knowledge Transformation. In
this model, the path to making an evidence-based decision is paved out with
discrete steps, starting at a stage termed 'Discovery'. Importantly, the
cyclical nature of the model implies that the process of knowledge
transformation does not end with stage 5 'Process, outcome evaluation', but
rather continues as new evidence from research or information from the patient's
individual circumstances comes to light.

<exercise id="10" title="What constitutes 'good' research evidence?">

Although evidence-based practice must consider sources outside of research
evidence to inform decision-making, nurses must still be knowledgeable consumers
of research in order to use evidence effectively to guide practice. Central to
this is the understanding that different types of research designs are
appropriate for different research question. For example, in most cases, the
most rigorous research design to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of an
intervention is the randomized controlled trial design. Other research designs
are more appropriate to use when the research question instead focuses on, for
example, exploring the lived experience of patients with a specific disease or
condition. This concept can be broadly referred to as clinical and contextual
relevance. Many critical appraisal tools contain items that draw clinician's
attention to the clinical and contextual relevance of the piece of research
being evaluated. For example, section C of the
<a href="https://casp-uk.net/casp-tools-checklists/">CASP</a> (Crticial
Appraisal Skills Program) suite of tools pictured below asks the question,
_'Will the results help locally?'_.

# Methodological quality

Another core component in deciding what constitutes 'good' research evidence
concerns _how_ research is conducted. The way in which research is conducted has
a great influence on the conclusions we can draw from it. As we touched on
earlier, evidence hierarchies seldom tell the whole story. A systematic review
that combined the results of many small randomized controlled trials, which each
had limitations in the way they carried out important elements of study
procedures such as the randomization procedure and concealment of assigned
interventions from participants and outcome assessors, would not provide as
important information as a rigorously conducted single randomized controlled
trial - despite the fact that it is 'lower' down on an evidence hierarchy such
as that pictured below.

<br>

# GRADE

<p>All research generates evidence. However, not all evidence is the same, and it is important that the best evidence is used in nursing and midwifery practice. To that end, an internationally recognized approach known as <a href="http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/">GRADE</a> (which stands for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) is recommended as the standard in clinical guideline development. The GRADE system is also used in <a href="https://www.cochrane.org">Cochrane Collaboration</a> systematic reviews to grade the quality of evidence. This system of grading the quality of evidence updates earlier advice that used only research design considerations for evidence grading. By contrast, the GRADE approach involves rating the quality of evidence for each outcome along a continuum of very low, low, moderate or high quality.</p>

<p>Evidence from a randomised controlled trial (or meta-analysis where the results of multiple randomised controlled trials have been combined using a statistical approach) is automatically assigned a rating of <em><strong>high</strong></em> quality and non-randomised studies automatically assigned a <em><strong>low</strong></em> rating. However, the evidence rating is then <em><strong>modified downward</strong> </em>if there are concerns about:</p>

- The risk of <em><strong>bias</strong></em> associated with the design of the
  study or studies that provided evidence for that outcome (termed study
  limitations by GRADE and assessed by risk of detection, performance,
  attrition);
- How <em><strong>precise</strong></em> the results of a study are (termed
  imprecision by GRADE);
- The degree to which results from different similar studies (comparing the same
  interventions for example) have <em><strong>varied</strong></em> (termed
  <strong>inconsistency</strong> by GRADE);
- The evidence available not being totally <em><strong>relevant</strong></em> to
  the research question at hand (termed indirectness by GRADE);
- The completeness of <em><strong>reporting</strong></em> of research (termed
  publication bias by grade).

It is also possible to <strong><em>upgrade</em></strong> the quality of evidence
assigned to an outcome from a non-randomised or observational study. Upgrading
evidence quality for an observational study can be considered when a
dose-response gradient is present and large effects are identified (i.e. 2-5
fold reductions or increases in risk) (Guyatt et al., 2011).</p>

<qu>Later in the course, we'll be going into far greater detail about the
methodological aspects of different research designs that are important to
consider when deciding about the quality of research evidence that is available
to inform decision-making as one component of the evidence-based practice
framework.</qu>

<exercise id="11" title="Why do we need evidence-based practice?">

An abundance of research has been undertaken to evaluate the effects of using
evidence-based practice. In general, the benefits of evidence-based practice
include that patients have better outcomes, the practitioner can have an
increased sense of confidence that their decisions and actions are based on
sound rationale and evidence

- Professional accountability and justification of actions
- Basis for team collaboration regarding plan of care
- Empowerment of patients and families

A landmark
<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa022615" >study</a> in the
US by Elizabeth McGlynn and colleagues (2003) revealed that:

- Patients received only 55% of recommended care;
- Range in getting the right care varies according to medical condition; and
- 20 – 30% of patients received unnecessary/harmful care.

Substantial progress has been made in ensuring that health professionals are
capable users of evidence in their practice. Recently, a consensus statement on
core competencies in evidence-based practice for health professionals were
developed. This resource may be helpful for you in future administration and
leadership roles when advocating for support and resources required by nursing
staff to be able to fulfill these competencies.

<exercise id="14" title="Discussion board">

Don't forget to head back to Quercus to participate in the discussion activity
with the class.

This week, you are asked to consider the question,

**"What is the 'evidence' we need for leadership and administration in
nursing?"**

You may like to think about this in terms of providing some examples of research
questions/issues/problems are most highly relevant to this field. It may also
help to think about and discuss what specific outcomes are highly relevant to
leadership and administration issues in nursing.

Each original post should be a maximum of 200 words. It's a good idea to use APA
referencing for evidence cited in your posts, as this is what will be expected
of you in the written assignments also. You are also required to respond to at
least one of your peer's posts.
