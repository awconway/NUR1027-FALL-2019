# EBP/KT Framework Critique

In this paper you will critique a framework or model for evidence-based nursing
practice or knowledge translation.

_You will provide:_

- an in-depth description of the framework;
- a critical analysis of the framework; and
- a discussion of the framework’s relevancy and application to nursing practice.

_Consider these points:_

- Describe framework (purpose, components, process)
- Critically analyze the framework
  - Appropriateness/fit for intended purpose
  - Strengths and limitations in enhancing quality of care/service
- Conclusion
  - Useful? Under what circumstances?

**More information is in assignment tab in Quercus**

The first assignment for this course is a critique of an evidence based practice
or knowledge translation framework. The first two weeks of the course are
dedicated to these topics. This is a critical analysis of the framework, so
you're looking at such things as the appropriateness or how well the models fits
with it's intended purpose whether that be promoting evidence based practice in
general or a more focused framework geared towards moving knowledge into
practice. Be sure to address the strengths and limitations of the model and draw
your conclusions about what circumstances the model would be most effective.
Please head over to the assignment tab in Quercus for more information about the
requirements for structuring the assignment as well as the marking criteria. You
may also find the example of a past assignment useful to review.

# Practice Question and Search Strategy

- Develop a practice question that can be answered with empirical literature,
  and locate relevant literature:

  - Background with rationale for conducting search
  - Structured search question
  - Identify relevant search terms

- Search 2 databases

  - Describe search process (attach copy of search history)

- Conclusion
  - what did you find?

**More information in assignment tab in Quercus**

The second assignment for this course is a clinical practice question and search
strategy. You'll need to develop a practice question, which could be focused on
a clinical or administrative-type problem. The question should be structured in
a way that facilitates being answered with evidence from published research
studies. You'll then need to locate relevant research literature in order to
address that question. Components of the assignment should include the
background and rationale for conducting the search, a structured search
question, and identification of appropriate search terms. Two databases are
required to be searched and we expect a description of the search process as
well as an attachment of the search history in an appendix that does not
contribute toward the word count for the assignment. A conclusion with a summary
of how well the search strategy performed in identifying relevant literature
will also be required. Again, please head over to the Assignments section of the
Quercus page for more details, and pay particular attention to the rubric which
outlines how your work will be assessed. There is also a sample assignment from
a previous student so that you can get a sense of the content and structure of
the assignment.

# Analysis of a Research Report

The paper will comprise three components including:

- Study Overview
  - Aims
  - Methods
  - Findings
- Analysis of philosophical underpinnings
  - Key elements characterizing the philosophical paradigm that guided the study
- Analysis of research methods

**More information in assignment tab in Quercus**

The third assignment for this course requires you to analyse a research report.
For this assignment you'll select one of two research papers that I will provide
for you and then you will analyze that study. The analysis will comprise three
components. First, I want you to provide a summary of the study including the
research aims, the methods that were used and the key study findings. Then in
the next component, I want you to analyze the key elements characterizing the
philosophical paradigm that guided the study. In week 5, I'll be teaching you
about the concepts of ontology, epistemology and methodology that will help you
to undertake this analysis. The final component should be a detailed analysis of
the research methods used in the study. In Weeks 6 through to the end of the
course we will cover the content you need to be able to identify strengths and
weaknesses of different types of quantitative and qualitative research designs.
Be sure to review the information in the assignments tab about this paper in
detail. There is an example paper provided. I strongly advise you check that
out. And of course feel free to ask me any questions you may have about the
assessment.
