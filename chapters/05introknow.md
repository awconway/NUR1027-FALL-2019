<exercise id="2" title="Ontology">

If a researcher decides to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine if a nurse-led psychosocial intervention decreases symptoms of depression after stroke, what ontology has informed their view of reality? 

<choice>

<opt text="Relativism">

Relativistis believe that multiple realities exist that need to be interpreted. This is not aligned with the RCT design, that uses objective measurements with the main aim being 'generalization'.

</opt>

<opt text="Realism" correct="TRUE">
Although you will never read a statement about the researcher's 'ontology' in the methods section of an RCT, the fact that this design was chosen implies that researchers are indeed aligned with a 'realist' ontology. Great work! Now - on to epistemology:sunglasses:

<exercise id="6" title="Multiple paradigms of nursing science">

This <a href="https://oce-ovid-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/00012272-199906000-00010/HTML">
article</a> will introduce you to two paradigms in particular: Empiricism and the Interpretive paradigm. While reading this, try and keep in mind what we just learnt about ontology. What ontological view is aligned with the Interprative paradigm? Realist or Relativism??


</exercise>

<exercise id="7" title="Summary of approaches to knowledge production">

This diagram may be useful in helping you understand how the different paradigms align with ontology and epistemology. It is clear that positivist and interpretivism are opposites, with critical realism borrowing aspects from both ontological and epistemological viewpoints. Research conducted within the critical realism paradigm often uses qualitative methodology or mixed methods.

# Positivism/Postpositivism Paradigms
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ontology**|View of the world is that there is one single objective external reality, which can be measured and known.|
|   |Empirically observable elements/events through the human senses/ value-free [postpositivists’ believe reality is never fully apprehended]|
|**Epistemology**|Observable and measurable facts|
|**Research methodology**|Quantitative approach would be used to explain or predict (using quantitative study designs) to generate new knowledge via deductive logical reasoning/hypotheses testing|
|   |Data collection - concepts are operationalized/measured (e.g., questionnaires; physiological measures)|
|   |Statistical analysis focuses on generalization|

# Interpretivist/Constructivist Paradigm
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Relativist ontology**| Reality is constructed through the meanings and understandings developed from subjective experiences of individuals/ interactive dialogue<br> Multiple realities (that need to be interpreted)<br><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>Reality is socially constructed and dynamic<br>Subjective reality|
|**Epistemology**|We cannot separate ourselves from what we know; knowledge is co-constructed/socially constructed; inductive reasoning|
|**Research methodology**|Qualitative approach- naturalistic inquiry (e.g., phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography); data collection- e.g., interviews, observations; data analysis- e.g., content/thematic analysis; unique/dynamic understanding of the phenomenon|

# Critical Social Paradigm

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Ontology** | Reality is created and shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, ethnic and/or gender-based/feminists factors|
| **Epistemology** | We cannot separate ourselves from what we know; critique of social conditions for the purpose of creating change; uncover power relationships/empower the oppressed|
|**Research Methodology**| Qualitative or mixed methods research approach; examine social conditions; goal is to change the situation/system (e.g., social change/ change inequities); emancipatory research/action research|

<exercise id="8" title="Research paradigms explained">

That brings to an end the summary of important concepts around research paradigms that I wanted to introduce you to this week :raised_hands:

To bring everything together, you may like to read through this <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b0c7/fcfee6ef80993ef8344453a9ed8c905200da.pdf">paper</a>. It includes illustrative examples from nursing researchers about their thought processes in choosing a research paradigm and how their final decision then informed each component of the design of their studies, including the methodology and methods.

<exercise id="9" title="Readings">

*Required*

Gray, J.R., & Grove, S.K.  (2021). The Practice of Nursing Research (9th ed.) Chapter 2: Evolution of research in building evidence-based nursing practice (Review the section on “Methodologies for developing Research Evidence in Nursing”).

<exercise id="10" title="Discussion">


In this week’s readings, you have encountered the different ways major approaches to research have been categorized.

- Reflecting on your clinical and/or research experiences, how would you describe your own epistemological, ontological, and methodological assumptions? Think about which of the approaches we have explored is/are closest to your own assumptions about truth, knowledge, and the nature of reality.
- Think back to the practice question you developed in Week 3. Which paradigm does your question fit into? Why?
