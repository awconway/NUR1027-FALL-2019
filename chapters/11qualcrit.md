<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

Hello! It is my pleasure to join you for a guest session on critical appraisal
of qualitative research methods. I am an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of
Nursing and my program of research is focused on understanding the commercial
determinants of health â€“ how the activities of corporations and other commercial
entities influence health and healthcare.

I predominantly rely on qualitative methodologies in my research and in this
module, I aim to provide an overview of these approaches from the perspective of
a researcher, but more importantly, as a research consumer. At the end of these
sessions, I hope you will feel more confident in your ability to critically
assess the qualitative research you read and rely on. A secondary aim, however,
is to help you appreciate qualitative methodologies as an area of expertise in
its own right and to understand your own limitations around reviewing and
conducting qualitative research. Just as you would call on a biostatician to
help design and conduct a study using advanced quantitative methods, you may
also have to call upon your friendly local qualitative methodologist!

For this week, I invite you to:

1. Work through the readings at your own pace.

2. Listen to the podcast.

3. On your own, conduct a social identity map.

- Using the paper by Jacobson & Mustafa (2019) as a guide, see if you can map
  out your own positionality in relation to your area of clinical or research
  interest.
