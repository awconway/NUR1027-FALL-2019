<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

<qu>The aim of Qualitative Description is to describe a phenomenom, or to understand the who, what, where and why of an event or experience.</qu> 

# Objectives

1) Understand and critique qualitative descriptive design and its fundamental features and characteristics.

2) Critically appraise and interpret findings from qualitative descriptive studies and consider relevance to practice. 


# Key terms and concepts 
* Generic qualitative research

* Qualitative description 

* Interpretive description

Some key terms to keep in mind while we review the information from this week will include: generic qualitative research; qualitative description; and interpretive description. Particulary, understanding that qualitative description is distinctly different from interpretive descriptive research. 


<qu>"Qualitative description is a 'distributed residual category' in the classification of these methods. Its value lies not only in the knowledge its use can produce, but also as a vehicle for presenting and treating research methods as living entitites that resist simple classification."</qu>

<sub>[Sandelowski, 2010, p.77](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v33i0001/77_wianqdr.xml)</sub>

Unlike other qualitative research methods, there's a paucity of information in the existing literature to classify what is qualitative description. This level of uncertainty can be challenging to develop a firm grasp of the approach. But the lack of clear boundaries is not to say that qualitative descriptive studies don't have defining features or characteristics. Nor does it mean that you can use the term as all-encompassing to disguise poorly designed and conducted studies. 

As [Sandelowski (2010)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v33i0001/77_wianqdr.xml) commented, she viewed qualitative description as a distributed residual category. The lack of clear boundaries with the approach allows for more innovative and thoughtful combinations of congruent methods and techniques to potentially develop or re-invent new methods.

<exercise id="2" title="Generic Qualitative Research">


'Generic' qualitative research doesn't conform to any of the established qualitative approaches [(Kahlke, 2014)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119).  [Caelli et al.](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf) defines generic qualitative research as qualitative research that's "not guided by an explicit or established set of philosphic assumptions in the form of one of the known qualitative methodologies" (2003, p.2). 'Known' qualitative methodologies would include, for example, phenomenology or grounded theory.


<img src="/genqual.png" height="400px" width="100%" />

<qu> Qualitative description and interpretive description are considered "subcategories" of generic qualitative research</qu> 
<sub>[Kahlke, 2014, p.37](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119)</sub> 

It's important to recognize the distinction between the two (qualitative description and interpretive description). The intent of qualitative description is to stay close to the data to produce a descriptive summary that is communicated in the informant's everyday language [(Sandelowski, 2000;](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v23i0004/334_whtqd.xml) [Neergaard et al., 2009)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). With interpretive description, producing a description alone is insufficient. Rather, the researcher should produce a "coherent conceptual description" that provides greater theoretical knowledge, and explores clinical patterns or structural observations of the clinical phenomena of interest with implications to practice [(Thorne et al., 2004, p. 4)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940690400300101).

<exercise id="4" title="Qualitative Description">

Qualitative description is a qualitative approach founded in "existing knowledge where thoughtful linkages are made to the clinical and research work of others", and aims to describe the participant's perception or experience of a phenomena [(Neergaard et al., 2009, p.2)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). It's inductive approach makes it appropriate for "problem identification, hypothesis generation, theory formation, or concept development" [(Neergaard et al., 2009, p.2)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). 

The complex components of distinct qualitative approaches like phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, narrative or case study makes qualitative description an appealing approach for nursing research [(Sandelowski, 2000)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v23i0004/334_whtqd.xml).

<qu>“It is rarely feasible for researchers to engage in a deeply theoretical and methodologically sophisticated study, yet this should not exclude clinicians from thoughtful rigorous inquiry.”</qu> 
<sub>[Caelli et al., 2003, p.2](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf)</sub> 

It's not always reasonable for clinician researchers to conduct "deeply theoretical and methodologically sophisticated" qualitative studies, but that shouldn't deter them from engaging in qualitative research that maintains "thoughtful and rigorous inquiry" [(Caelli et al., 2003, p.2)](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf).  

Sandelowski [(2000, p.335)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v23i0004/334_whtqd.xml) explains that qualitative description is it's own research method, rather than a "nursing adaptation of grounded theory, phenomenology, and ethnography".

# In summary...


## Philosophy: 
* Pragmatic approach with overtones for other qualitative approaches.

Qualitative Description is a pragmatic approach that can have overtones and textures from other qualitative approaches such as phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, or narrative [(Neergaard et al., 2009)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). 

## Theoretical orientation: 
* Naturalism 

While Qualitative Description can be viewed as the least theoretical among qualitative approaches, it is oriented in naturalistic inquiry, which means a "committment to study the phenomena in its natural state" with no manipulation of variables or theoretical position determined a priori [(Sandelowski, 2000, p.337)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v23i0004/334_whtqd.xml).

## Design features: 

### Sampling: 
* Purposive sampling strategy (e.g., maximum variation)

In terms of design features such as sampling, Neergaard et al. [(2009)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52) explains that purposive sampling techniques may be used, and that in particular, maximum variation, where there may be a small sample size but the researcher samples participants from extremes, may be more useful to gather broader insight on the subject.

### Data collection: 
* Open-ended questions in individual or focus group interviews

With regards to data collection tools or strategies that can be employed for Qualitative Description, semi-structured interviews with open-ended guiding questions are commonly used, either in individual or focus group interviews. 

### Data analysis: 
* Variation of qualitative content analysis

Finally, for data analysis, the researcher stays close to the data, which is why Qualitative Description is considered to have a lower level of interpretation compared to other qualitative approaches. A variation of content analysis is commonly used to analyze the text data, such as using "in vivo coding". 

As the analysis is subject to the researcher’s biases, so to reduce the subjectivity, the researcher can involve other researchers to preserve the integrity and neutrality of the analysis [(Neergaard et al., 2009)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). Some studies also summarize the data with descriptive statistics. 

Qualitative Description should never be mistaken for Interpretive Description or pattern analysis, where Interpretive Description aims to provide in-depth conceptual understanding of phenomenon, and pattern analysis seeks to describe patterns in data based on specific factors (e.g., demographics, SES).

## Reporting results: 
* Descriptive summary

The final product that the approach aims to produce is a description of the participant’s experience described in the language and terms that the participant used.

<exercise id="5" title="Addressing Misconceptions">

Sandelowski provides some clarification in these two articles on the common misconceptions of Qualitative Description, including the theoretical orientation, classification, and data analysis and interpretation of Qualiative Descriptive research.

- [What's in a name? Qualitative description revisited](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v33i0001/77_wianqdr.xml)

</exercise>


<exercise id="6" title="Considerations">

Now that we've reviewed the characteristics of Qualitative Description, let's cover some of the common critiques and limitations of the approach. These critiques include:

* Reputation of being low-quality 

* Limited guidance to conduct the research

* No methodological viewpoint

* Risk of 'method-slurring'

# Reputation of being low-quality 
In terms of the quality of research design, Qualitative Description has developed a reputation for being low-quality. These critiques of the approach often stem from the lack of clear criteria in existing literature to differentiate "good" qualitative research from that which is weak or poorly designed [(Caelli et al., 2003, p.3)](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf). 

As Sandelowski [(2000, p.334)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v23i0004/334_whtqd.xml) explained, the hierarchy for evidence-based research values "prediction and control" as the gold standard. However, with qualitative research, there is no universal set of criteria for evaluating quality. Rather, like Caelli et al. [(2003, p.4)](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf) states, "each qualitative approach needs to be evaluated in a manner that is congruent with its epistemological and methodological origins". And it's the responsibility of the researchers conducting the study to provide a "knowledge and theoretically informed" explanation for why they selected the research approach [(Caelli et al., 2003, p.7)](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf), as well as "enough details about the study, the approach, and the methods...so that the reader can appropriately evaluate the research" [(p.4)](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf).

# Limited guidance to conduct the research
Qualitative description is commonly used in nursing and health care research, but the existing literature lacks guidance on it as a distinct approach compared to other qualitative research approaches. While this provides flexibility for researchers to develop innovative ways to revisit previously explored topics or phenomena, to the novice researcher, this may present as a challenge to work outside of well-established methodological boundaries [(Kahlke, 2014)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119). However, as Kahlke [(2014, p.49)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119) explains, these concerns can be mitigated with “careful consideration of all the elements of the research framework, the guidance of an experienced supervisor or mentor, and wide reading about qualitative methodological debates broadly, and the methodologies that the study is ‘borrowing’ from". 

# No methodological viewpoint
Be cautious of studies that "claims no methodological viewpoint at all" [(Caelli et al., 2003, p.4)](http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/backissues/2_2/pdf/caellietal.pdf). As Kahlke [(2014)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119) states, "research can never be design on a blank state" [(p.39)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119). All research draws on traditions and ideas that came before it [(Crotty, 1998)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=Op_SDKrf1ZQC&lpg=PR6-IA1&ots=RtJy_9qXz0&dq=crotty%201998&lr&pg=PR6-IA1#v=onepage&q=crotty%201998&f=false).  

# Risk of 'method-slurring'
Finally, whether you're conducting or evaluating qualitative descriptive research, it's important to be wary of 'method-slurring', which is when incompatible, but well-established methodologies are mixed together under the claim that using one methodology is insufficient to capture a phenomenon [(Kahlke, 2014)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119). In such cases, it may be more appropriate for the researcher to develop a new qualitative descriptive framework, including theoretical assumptions, methodology and methods to answer the research question rather than attempting to "reconcile different methodologies already in existence" [(Kahlke, 2014, p.46)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119). 

<img src="/phenomenology.png" height="400px" width="100%" />

An example of method-slurring that Kahlke [(2014)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119) mentions is a case where the researchers attempted to design a study with grounded theory through hermeneutic-phenomenology. These two methodologies have vastly different theoretical assumptions- while phenomenology attempts to explore and understand the subjective experiences of study participants, grounded theory assumes that there's "a degree of objective truth that can be accessed
by the researcher" [(Bryant & Charmaz, 2007)](https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781848607941). Thus it's paramount to be well aware of "issues of incongruence" when attempting to blend tools and techniques from multiple methodologies [(Kahlke, 2004, p.45)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119).

As Kahlke discusses, it's possible to blend together the use of compatible "tools and techniques from more than one established methodology" [(p.39)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/160940691401300119) so long as careful thought is taken to ensure that they fit well at all levels of the research. 

In other instances, researchers may feel the need to defend their study as being more than a description, and attempt to position their research as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, narrative inquiry, or a case study without actually involving the characteristics of those approaches, or engaging in the complex design [(Sandelowski, 2000)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v23i0004/334_whtqd.xml).

<exercise id="7" title="Establishing Trustworthiness of the Data">

Since we've discussed the critiques of Qualitative Description, let's revisit how we can apply the four key components to strengthen the trustworthiness of the research.

## 1) Credibility: 
* E.g., Member checks

With regards to credibility, or the level of confidence that can be placed in the truth of the research findings, the research can conduct member checks. For example, the researcher can ask participants to review collected data and interpretations of data for whether their perspectives were captured correctly.

## 2) Transferability: 
* E.g., Purposive sampling strategy such as maximum variation

In terms of transferability of the findings, or the degree to which the results of the research can be transferred to other contexts or settings, the researcher can employ maximum variation in sampling to capture a broader description of perspectives. 

## 3) Dependability: 
* E.g., Audit trail of data

To enhance the dependability of the findings, or the stability of findings over time, the researcher can document and ensure transparency in describing the research steps taken from the start of research to development and reporting of findings.

## 4) Confirmability: 
* E.g., Code book for development of content analysis

Moreover, to ensure confirmability, or the degree to which the findings can be confirmed by other researchers, the researcher can maintain a code book for the content analysis to document the process of how themes or ideas arose from the text data.   

</exercise>

<exercise id="8" title="Advantages">
Now, let's review the strengths and advantages to Qualitative Description: 

* Pragmatic approach

* Useful for mixed methods research or developing interventions

* Advantageous if limited in time and resources

## Pragmatic approach
As we previously discussed, it provides a pragmatic approach to inquiry as the phenomena of interest is often situated in a clinical concern, and is thus a highly relevant and applicable method to nursing and health care research. 

## Useful for mixed methods research or developing interventions
In addition, because Qualitative Description helps to gain insight into participants’ views of a particular, narrow topic, the descriptive summary that it produces can be the foundation for working hypotheses or key categories for theory-based research. This can be	useful for mixed methods or developing interventions, or needs assessments (e.g., When patient perspectives and evaluations are the goals of the research because Qualitative Description presents the facts from informants’ point of view).

## Advantageous if limited in time and resources
Furthermore, an advantage to employing a Qualitative Descriptive approach is because of it's low-inference, it's appropriate for situations where time and resources may be limited.

<exercise id="9" title="Exercise">

<br><br>
Which of these statements is true?<br><br>

<choice>


<opt text="Qualitative descriptive research is theoretical.">

Although qualitative descriptive research has been described as the 'least theoretical' of approaches [Sandelowski, 2000, p.337], it is theoretically oriented to naturalism. 

</opt>


<opt text="Qualitative descriptive research is interpretive." correct="true">
 
Good job! As Sandelowski [2010, p.335] states, 'all description requires interpretation'. While in comparison, qualitative descriptive research is less interpretive than other qualitative approaches such as phenomenology or grounded theory, it still requires the researchers to make sense of the data and to 'move somewhere' [p.79].

</opt>


<opt text="Qualitative description has no defining methodological characteristics.">

While it may seem difficult to generalize a methodology for qualitative descriptive studies, as Sandelowski <a href="">(2010)</a> discusses, there are typical design characteristics such as purposive sampling strategies, open-ended questions guiding individual or focus group interviews for data collection, and the use of some variation of content analysis to interpret the data to produce a descriptive summary.   

</opt>


<opt text="Using a qualitative descriptive approach means that the researcher will not have to analyze or interpret the collected data.">

It's important to remember that even with qualitative descriptive research, the data cannot speak for itself and requires the researcher's interpretation of the data to produce a 'presentation of the facts of the case in everyday language' <a href="">(Sandelowski, 2000, p.335)</a>. 

</opt>

</choice>

</exercise>


<exercise id="10" title="Final Thoughts">

<qu> "The value of qualitative description lies not only in the knowledge its use can produce, but also as a vehicle for presenting and treating research methods as living entities that resist simple classiﬁcation."</qu>
<sub> [Sandelowski, 2010, p.83](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v33i0001/77_wianqdr.xml) </sub> 

Let's take a moment to revisit [Sandelowski's (2010)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v33i0001/77_wianqdr.xml) final thoughts about Qualitative Description. She conluded that the value of Qualitative Description lies not only in the knowledge its use can produce, but also as a vehicle for presenting and treating research methods as living entities that resist simple classification. 

While Qualitative Description has gained critiques for being vague and low-inference, and thus less useful, these critiques are due in part to misunderstanding the approach's aim and lack of clear boundaries [(Neergaard et al., 2009)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). Qualitative Description should only be used if the aim is to describe a phenomenon [(Neergaard et al., 2009)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-9-52). And Sandelowski [(2010, p.82)](http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/01606891/v33i0001/77_wianqdr.xml) reminds us that qualitative research doesn't have to be instructional, and that the lack of clear boundaries allows for variations in methods, as methods are not static but "alive", dynamic, and every-changing. Finally, as [Lincoln and Guba (1985)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosn006) have argued, qualitative research (or naturalistic inquiry) needs other criteria for meeting credibility than more positivistic approaches.
