<exercise id="8" title="Facilitation">

Kitson and Harvey make the case in <a href="https://sigmapubs-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/doi/full/10.1111/jnu.12206?sid=Ovid%3Aovftdb">this</a> paper that active 'facilitation' is the key ingredient in translating new knowledge into practice in healthcare. This concept is a core element of one of the knowledge translation models, known as PARIHS.

<exercise id="10" title="Choosing a framework">


Choose which framework may be preferable, considering the following example:

<qu>
A general medical ward has identified an area of practice they would like to change in light of new evidence identified from a systematic review. There are no extra resources available to assist with the knowledge translation activities for the unit.

</qu>

<choice>

<opt text="iPARIHS">

The number of staff, and the time available to them to participate in the implementation project should be considered. Facilitation, which is a core component of PARIHS, requires a substantial time investment for one or more person to act as facilitator. Approaches that are more aligned to strategies such as training and audit and feedback sessions might be easier to implement with less staff or resource support.

</opt>

<opt text="KTA" correct="TRUE">

Following this model may allow the unit with the flexibility to gain insight about the effectiveness of the on-going implementation process and utilize a suite of strategies that might be easier to implement with less staff and resource support in comparison with the i-PARIHS framework. Facilitation, which is a core component of PARIHS, requires a substantial time investment for one or more person to act as facilitator.

<exercise id="14" title="Discussion">

Time to head back to Quercus and participate in the online class <a target="_parent" href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/161379/discussion_topics/">discussion</a>. This week we'll be using the resource below to structure our discussions in the groups. 

Each of you (individually) are asked to  complete the learning activity outlined below using the Barwick template.

For this week's discussion, consider a practice in your work environment that you think could be improved. What is the current practice, and what is the proposed evidence-informed change? 

Briefly describe the current practice you have identified, and the proposed evidence-informed change. Using the Knowledge Translation Planning Template developed by Melanie Barwick (2013), identify one group of knowledge users for the change (Cell 5 in the template). Then develop a brief main message for this audience (Cell 6 in the template). Formulate 1 KT goal (Cell 7) and identify 1-2 appropriate KT strategies (Cell 8). 


**Remember to respond to one of your peer’s posts!**
